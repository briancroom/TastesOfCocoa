# TastesOfCocoa
*A collection of small demos, tests, and experiments revolving around Objective-C, Swift, and Apple development*

When I am exploring new corners of the Cocoa APIs, improving my understanding of the fast-changing Swift stdlib, or just trying out wild ideas, I often find myself making quick one-off projects and playgrounds that languish on my hard drive. This repo is an attempt to start collecting these for later reference and knowledge-sharing.
